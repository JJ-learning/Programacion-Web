# ShortCut
This is a microblogging social network similar to Twitter. It's not finished at all, but all the features included work perfectly fine. It was done as a university project for the Web Developing subject. 

It was devceloped using Django 1.7.1 version and Python 2.7.6 version, so it could be outdated and may not work in the newest versions of Django and Python.

If you want to try these project you need:

      - To create a Mblog folder and paste the files uploaded here in there, since this is the files of the Django project. Mblog is the project and shortcut is the app.
      - To create a local server with Django and configure it to open this project in the main page. 
      - To create a database for the users, the shortcuts and the user profiles, described in the shortcut/models.py.
      
The PDF file attached describes the structure of the app and how to use the site, but for now it's only avalaible in spanish, sorry for the inconvenience. I will upaload one in english as soon as I can. The db.sqlite file is a created database ready to use, with some users, shorcuts and follows between the users. You can use this if you want to, the credentials are in the PDF file.

The User class used in the project is the one that provides the Django framework itself, which it allows you to administrate the users and its accounts from the the Django admin interface.

All the settings of the Django framework in this project are explained in the Django documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/

This project is outdated and it should be updated to the newest versions of Django and Python, but I didn't have the time since I finished it for the subject, thopugh I always wanted to invest more time in this project, with learning purposes. 

You can use my code as a guide if you want to create something similar to this. O know that not all the code is commented (shame on me), but I think that is pretty clear and with a minimum knowledge of the language and the framework you can figure it out how to use it, change it or even improve it. 

The Logo and the colors were made and chosen by me, so don't use them with commercial purposes, please. 

One last thing, if you use something from this project I would thank you a lot if you name me or include this repository in your bibliography. May the force be with you! :)
